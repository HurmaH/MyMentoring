Class are template of objects
 Class - Animal
 
 properties/fields, varialble (coming outside of methods)
 behaviors()/methods()
 Methods: 
         - Methods are behaviour that contains repeatable code/reusable actions/statements.
          - Methods are behaviour of classes/objects
         - grouping things together
         - breaking things apart
         
 Why Methods are used:
 - code readibility
 - code reusibility
 - easy maintain the code
 - easier to debug
 
 methods that we know so far :
  
  *main method :
		special method that start and run your program
 
 *Scanner class methods :
		next()
		nextX()..
		
*String class methods
         strObject.length()
		strObject.subString(1,4)
		strObject.charAt(0)
		
*Arrays class methods
		Arrays.toString(arrobject)
		Arrays.sort(arrobject)

-------------------------------------------
void no return
instead of void : Privitive data types, and Objects
Access modifier |  specifier | return type     |method name| parameters| method body
    (Optional)    (optional)       (required)    (required) 
      
      public        static           void           main        ()          { }
      
      
      Methods observed:
      
      1, method without return value (with void)
      2, method with return value (with return type= primitive data types or Objects )
      3, method that does not take external data when being called
          name4 ();
          str.length();
          strObject.toLowerCase();
          
      4, method that take external data when being called
          name4("hi");
          str.charAt(4);
          
      5, some methods need an object for calling 
          str.trim(); //str is objects
          
      6, some methods does not need objects
          name4 ();
          
 ---------------------------------------------------
 questions to answer when you are creating methods:
  1. is object required to call this method?  
     Ex: Animal a = new Animal();
         a.makeNoise();
         
  2. do we have to pass external data or not
     name ();        no need to external data
     name4 ("hi");   need external data/arguments/parameter
     
 3. is this method returning some value:
  void - no return
  data type (String, Objects, Wrapper class, Arrays, ArrayList)
  
  // BREAK VS RETURN
  
  return: used to return value 
          terminate method execution/stop method execution
          
  break : used inside switch and loop
